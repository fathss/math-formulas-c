# Fibonacci sequence
In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence which each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted _Fn_. 
<br><br>
The first 20 Fibonacci numbers _Fn_ are:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181 
```

Many writers begin the sequence with 0 and 1, although some authors start it from 1 and 1. The program i create will begin from 0.

The Fibonacci numbers may be defined by the recurrence relation
<pre>F0 = 0, F1 = 1,</pre>
and
<pre>Fn = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)</pre>
for n > 1
